The first Java project, with a lot of new things to discover and my unexperience, I have to finish in one month so it might not be clean and full function. Anyway, the project is really an interesting experience and a good opportunity for me to improve my programming and teamwork skill, I extremely appreciate it.

Hope you enjoy, too!

### Tech

UET Dictionary uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [VoiceRSS API SDK](http://www.voicerss.org/sdk/java.aspx) - A handy Text-to-speech SDK
* [JFoenix for Java8]() - A material design library for JavaFX
* [FontAwesomeFX version 8.9](https://bitbucket.org/Jerady/fontawesomefx/downloads/) - A plethora of icons in this increadible icon library

And of course UET Dictionary itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/Air-Sweeper/UET-Dictionary) on GitHub.
